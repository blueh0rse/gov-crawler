# TMA Project

Calculate privacy score for websites.

## Scoring System

Like NUTRI-SCORE.

From A (best) to E (worst).

## Criterias

- Data collection practices
  - Minimal Data Collection: Websites that only collect essential data score higher
  - Data Collection Transparency: Clear disclosure of what data is collected, how it's used, and with whom it's shared

- Cookie Management
  - Consent for Cookies: Sites should ask for consent before setting any cookies, except strictly necessary ones
  - Cookie Customization Options: Allowing users to choose which types of cookies they consent to (e.g., functional, analytics, advertising)
  - Respect for "Do Not Track": Websites should respect the DNT browser setting

- Tracking Techniques
  - Use of Third-Party Trackers: Fewer or no third-party trackers contribute to a higher privacy score.
  - Fingerprinting Protections: Measures against fingerprinting (tracking users based on their device characteristics) are positive.

- Data Security Measures
  - Encryption: Use of HTTPS for data transmission (looks dumb but we never know)
  - Data Breach History: Past incidents and their handling impact the score
  - Secure Data Storage: Proper safeguards for stored data

- Privacy Policy
  - Clarity and Accessibility: Easy-to-understand language and easy to find.
  - Frequency of Changes: Frequent changes can be a red flag.

- User Control Over Data
  - Data Access and Portability: Users should be able to access their data and transfer it.
  - Data Deletion Options: Allowing users to request data deletion.

- Advertising Practices
  - Behavioral Advertising: Use of personal data for targeted advertising negatively impacts the score.
  - Transparency in Ad Practices: Clear information about advertising data use.

- Compliance with Privacy Laws
  - GDPR, CCPA, and Other Regulations: Compliance with relevant privacy laws is crucial
